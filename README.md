# FrontLab - Cross-Framework Component Library

<a alt="Nx logo" href="https://nx.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/images/nx-logo.png" width="45"></a>

FrontLab is a playground for building and showcasing framework-agnostic web components that work seamlessly across multiple frontend frameworks. This project is built using Nx to manage a monorepo structure that includes various applications and libraries.

## Project Overview

This workspace demonstrates how to build web components once and use them everywhere:

- **Web Components**: Custom elements built with Lit and Lion Web Components
- **Multi-Framework Support**: Integration with React, Angular, and Vue
- **Consistent UX**: Same components, same behavior, different frameworks
- **Nx Workspace**: Leveraging Nx for managing the monorepo structure

## Project Goals

This workspace is designed to:

- Create truly reusable UI components that work across any modern framework
- Demonstrate integration patterns between web components and popular frameworks
- Reduce duplication by maintaining a single source of truth for component logic
- Showcase TypeScript integration with web components
- Provide a playground for experimenting with new UI patterns

## Getting Started

### Running the Applications

You can run any of the framework-specific applications to see the same components in action:

```sh
# Run the React application
npx nx serve react-app

# Run the Angular application
npx nx serve angular-app

# Run the Vue application
npx nx serve vue-app
```

Each will start a development server and open the application in your browser.

### Exploring the Demo

All applications demonstrate the same components with identical functionality, but implemented within different framework contexts. You can explore:

- Web Components built with Lion and Lit
- TypeScript integration in each framework
- Consistent styling across frameworks
- Framework-specific event handling patterns

Each application includes a navigation menu to easily switch between different examples.

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

To install a new plugin you can use the `nx add` command. Here's an example of adding the React plugin:

```sh
npx nx add @nx/react
```

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects. For example, to create a new React app or library:

```sh
# Generate an app
npx nx g @nx/react:app demo

# Generate a library
npx nx g @nx/react:lib some-lib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

## Set up CI!

### Step 1

To connect to Nx Cloud, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx connect
```

Connecting to Nx Cloud ensures a [fast and scalable CI](https://nx.dev/ci/intro/why-nx-cloud?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) pipeline. It includes features such as:

- [Remote caching](https://nx.dev/ci/features/remote-cache?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/ci/features/distribute-task-execution?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Automated e2e test splitting](https://nx.dev/ci/features/split-e2e-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task flakiness detection and rerunning](https://nx.dev/ci/features/flaky-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

### Step 2

Use the following command to configure a CI workflow for your workspace:

```sh
npx nx g ci-workflow
```
