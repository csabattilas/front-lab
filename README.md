# FrontLab - Component Library Playground

<a alt="Nx logo" href="https://nx.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/images/nx-logo.png" width="45"></a>

FrontLab is a playground for experimenting with modern web component libraries and frameworks. This project is built using Nx to manage a monorepo structure that includes various applications and libraries.

## Project Overview

This workspace demonstrates how to build and integrate web components across different frameworks:

- **Lion Web Components**: Custom elements built on top of the Lion Web Components library
- **React Integration**: Showing how to use web components in React applications
- **Nx Workspace**: Leveraging Nx for managing the monorepo structure

## Project Goals

This workspace is designed to:

- Explore modern web component libraries and frameworks
- Build reusable UI components that work across different frameworks
- Demonstrate integration patterns between web components and React
- Provide a playground for experimenting with new UI patterns

## Project Structure

```

├── apps/                   # Applications
├── libs/                   # Libraries
│   └── ui/                 # UI components
│       └── lion/           # Lion Web Components
│           └── selectable-button-group/  # Our custom component
└── react-app/             # React application for demo
```

## Getting Started

### Running the React Demo

To run the React application that demonstrates both implementations:

```sh
npx nx serve react-app
```

This will start a development server and open the application in your browser.

### Building the Component Library

To build the selectable button group component library:

```sh
npx nx build ui-lion-selectable-button-group
```

### Exploring the Demo

The React application demonstrates different component implementations and integration patterns. You can explore:

- Web Components built with Lion and Lit
- React implementations of similar components
- Integration between the two approaches

The demo includes a navigation menu to easily switch between different examples.

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

To install a new plugin you can use the `nx add` command. Here's an example of adding the React plugin:
```sh
npx nx add @nx/react
```

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects. For example, to create a new React app or library:

```sh
# Generate an app
npx nx g @nx/react:app demo

# Generate a library
npx nx g @nx/react:lib some-lib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

## Set up CI!

### Step 1

To connect to Nx Cloud, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx connect
```

Connecting to Nx Cloud ensures a [fast and scalable CI](https://nx.dev/ci/intro/why-nx-cloud?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) pipeline. It includes features such as:

- [Remote caching](https://nx.dev/ci/features/remote-cache?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/ci/features/distribute-task-execution?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Automated e2e test splitting](https://nx.dev/ci/features/split-e2e-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task flakiness detection and rerunning](https://nx.dev/ci/features/flaky-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

### Step 2

Use the following command to configure a CI workflow for your workspace:

```sh
npx nx g ci-workflow
```
